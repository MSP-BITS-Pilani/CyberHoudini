        question: 'An AI called the Blaze has taken over the systems of the tower in the island that it was housed in, and is threatening to hack past the security systems that keep it isolated from the internet. The tower is filled with water in the shaft that runs down the middle as part of an extensive cooling network for the electronics housed within the walls of the tower, and also acts like a way to cut the AI off from accessing the internet.\n You have found a way to drop a raft into the shaft, but your attempts at discretion fail and the AI detects you. Using a script that the scientists at base have given you, you manage to convince the AI into believing that it is not smart enough yet and that it needs to be shut down for updates. The AI agrees to shut down conditionally - you have to prove to it that it is not ready, by beating it at a game. Fortunately, the scientists at base have told you that the AI is not yet ready to play games and thus, you have a fair chance to win. Unfortunately, you have lost communication with base, and thus, you have to play to win. \n The AI wishes to drain the water in the cooling shaft because it wishes to access the internet without any barriers, and you wish to do the same so that you can access the root systems and shut it down. So the AI agrees that each of you can take turns lowering the level of water in the cooling shaft, which has twenty-five equally spaced stories. Control over lowering of water alternates between you and the AI, and the player who last lowers the water to reach level 0 is the one to win. You can lower the water level by either one, three or four stories each turn, and the AI has allowed you to go first. By how many levels of water should you lower the first time so as to not lose?',
